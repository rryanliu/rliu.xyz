After my abstract algebra final, Harry, Nathan and I went downtown to get hotpot.
On our drive back, Harry and I were thinking about a puzzle.
A rare stroke of inspiration hit me, and I began thinking about this problem in terms of Group Theory,
and I solved it before I dropped Harry off.
The statement is as follows:

Harry and Nathan have been trapped in a mental facility.
They are tired of being bound in straitjackets and toyed with by sadistic staff, and being fed nothing but stale bread.
Fortunately, the medical director wants to play a game with them for their freedom.
Harry and Nathan may discuss a strategy beforehand, but once the game begins,
no direct communication is allowed.
The rules are as follows:

There is a room with a modified chessboard.
Harry enters the room.
The medical director picks a square, opens it, and hides a key in this compartment.
Harry can see the location of the key.
Then, 64 coins are flipped and placed over the squares, with 1 coin on each square.

Now, Harry may flip up to one coin over.

After this, Harry exits the room, and Nathan enters the room.
Nathan must find the location of the key in 1 guess.
Otherwise, they are trapped in the psychiatric facility forever.
Devise a strategy to save Harry and Nathan.

How does this relate to Group Theory?

For those unfamiliar, let's go over the group axioms.
A group $(G, \cdot)$ is a set $G$ with an operation $\cdot$ such that

1. $\cdot$ is associative
2. $G$ has an element $e$ such that $\forall x \in G,\; x \cdot e = e \cdot x = x$
3. $\forall x \in G\; \exists x^{-1} \in G$ such that $x \cdot x^{-1} = x^{-1} \cdot x = e$
4. $\forall x, y \in G\; x \cdot y \in G$

For example: the set of integers under $+$.
1. $+$ is associative
2. $0 + x = x + 0 = x$.
3. $-x + x = x + -x = 0$.
4. the sum of 2 integers is an integer.

Ok, now let's apply it to our problem.
First, let's show $\mathbb{Z}/8\mathbb{Z}$ (as in the set $\{0, 1, \ldots, 7\}$) is a group under $\oplus$.

1. xor is associative
2. the identity element is 0
3. the inverse of each element is itself.
This is because when a bit is set in $x$, it is set in $x^{-1}$ to make that bit 0 after applying the operation.
And when a bit is unset in $x$, ... blah blah blah same reasoning.
4. taking the xor of 2 natural numbers with msb (most significant bit) $\le 3$ cannot result in a number with msb $> 3$ so it is closed

My solution:

Write the chessboard as an 8x8 matrix $A$
(0-indexed).
Let $A_{ij}$ be 1 if the coin in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column is heads, and 0 otherwise.
Let $p_i = A_{i0} \oplus A_{i1} \oplus \ldots \oplus A_{i7}$.
So, the xor of the coins in the $i$-th row.
Similarly, let $e_i = A_{0i} \oplus A_{1i} \oplus \ldots \oplus A_{7i}$.

Let $r = 0^{p_0} \oplus 1^{p_1} \oplus \ldots \oplus 7^{p_7}$.
In this case, $x^y$ does not mean $x$ to the power of $y$ under multiplication,
but rather $x^y \;=\; \underbrace{x \oplus x \oplus \cdots \oplus x}_{y\ \text{times}}$.
We can see that $x^y \in \{0, x\}$ because $x = x^{-1}$.

Let $c = 0^{e_0} \oplus 1^{e_1} \oplus \ldots \oplus 7^{e_7}$.
Let $(r^{\prime}, c^{\prime})$ be the location of the key.
How can we transform $(r, c)$ to $(r^{\prime}, c^{\prime})$ by flipping up to one single coin?

This is where my intuition in group theory guided me to a solution, although knowledge of group
theory is not required to solve this puzzle.
First, see that $x \oplus (x \oplus y) = x \oplus (x^{-1} \oplus y) = (x \oplus x^{-1}) \oplus y = 0 \oplus y = y$.
Since $r \oplus r^{\prime}$ is in $\mathbb{Z} / 8 \mathbb{Z}$ because $\mathbb{Z} / 8 \mathbb{Z}$ is closed, we can flip any coin in this corresponding row, and then recalculate new powers $p_i^{\prime}$ and apply our previous formula to obtain $r^{\prime}$.
Similarly, we can also flip a coin in the $c \oplus c^{\prime}$-th column to transform $c$ into $c^{\prime}$.

This works for a couple reasons:
First, there is always going to be an intersection between any row and column.
Secondly, $\oplus$ is an involution, so every element has order 2.
Therefore we need only flip up to one coin to transform an element into any element we desire.

So now, setting groups aside, Harry can just
flip the coin in row $r \oplus r^{\prime}$ and $c \oplus c^{\prime}$ (because $x = x^{-1}$).
Then, when Nathan comes in and calculates $r$ and $c$ using the same process described previously,
he will find that $r$ and $c$ mark the square with the key.

Now note that this will not work for $n \times n$ chessboards when $n$ is not a power of 2, because then
$\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z}$ is not closed under $\oplus$.
Think about combining with elements that have the msb flipped.

Personally I wouldn't leave the facility because bread tastes better than key
